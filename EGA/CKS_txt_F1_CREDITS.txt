You are now playing the source code mod
^cA "Foray in the Forest"

^cE This project was started by ^cA Mr. M ^cE back in
2009. After an unfortunate hard drive fail
and a full data loss, I - ^cA Nisaba ^cE - took over,
restarted the whole project from scratch,
and soon became the creative director.

But of course this mod wouldn't be possible
without the ingenuity, skill and patience of
a couple of very talented people.

^cE As the  CK source code  still has not been
released  yet,  and  spurred  by  ^cA NY00123's
^cE decision to make the KDreams tech demo,
^cA Lemm ^cE decided to add in the missing bits of
the Keen source by combining the Omnispeak
decompilation  effort,  NetKeen,  and  the
KDreams tech demo into one big Frankenmod.

Later  on,  ^cA K1n9_Duk3  ^cE joined  the  show,
complemented and improved the code even
further, and eventually became FitF's lead
programmer.  The result is this very neat
concoction.

^cE Many thanks to all additional, assisting and
co-supporting creative participants in this
project goes to the following list of fine
people.

All this would not have been possible without
your  great  contribution  in  the  form of
submissions,  ideas,  constructive criticisms,
your knowledge and shared skills, your moral
support,  and your creative products that I
have joyfully rummaged through and at times
secretly and blatantly ripped.

Thanks, PCKF, for helping me make my mod
visions come true!
