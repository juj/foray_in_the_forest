^cF COMPUTERWRIST MAIN MENU

^cE There are 9 choices in the Main Menu. They
are:  ^cA New Game|Load Game|Save Game|
Return to Game/Demo|End Game/View Scores
Nibbles Nom Nom|Help+Info|Configure|Quit

^cE The currently selected item will be high-
lighted, and there will be a flashing dot
beside it.  Items you cannot select will
have an "X" by them.

Use the ^cA arrow keys ^cE to move to the item
you wish to select, then press ^cA Enter ^cE to
choose that item.

Let's look at each of the sections in order...


^P
^cF NEW GAME

^cE You can choose to start a new game in ^cA easy
normal, ^cE or ^cA hard ^cE modes.  These will determine
a number of things, such as whether saving
the game state costs lives or not. The main
differences are:

^L80,142

^L80,186
normal
^L80,245
hard
^L90,38

^L120,42
^cElevel layout | ^c7basic  ^c8medium ^c0complex

^cEIf you are in the middle of a game and have
not saved it,  starting a new game will wipe
out that old game forever. You will be asked
for confirmation if you try to do this.


^P
^cF LOAD GAME

^cE If you have saved a game previously, load
game will allow you to load it in and play it.
If you haven't saved a game (basically when
you first get the game), the Load option will
not be available.

^cF SAVE GAME
^cE You may save up to six different games.
You can't save a game until you start one,
of course.  Name them whatever you wish.
If you leave the field blank, the current
date & time will be entered automatically.
Note that on normal and hard mode ^cA saving
will cost a life. ^cE As an exception you can save
on the worldmap without any losses.


^p
^cF LOAD/SAVE GAME - FUNCTION KEYS

^cE To speed up the loading/saving process,
there are now new function keys available.

You can either access the "LOAD/SAVE" menu
via the ^cA F2
^L70,76
^cE/ ^cA
^L70,84
F3 ^cE keys.

Alternatively, you can also use the convenient
quick-load/quick-save mechanism via a single
^cA F5
^L110,24
^cE/ ^cA
^L110,32
F9 ^cE
^L110,54
keystroke.

Note, however, that a confirmation dialog
appears when you save your game.  This
dialog can be disabled in the options menu.


^P
^cF RETURN TO GAME / DEMO

^cE If you went to the ComputerWrist from a
game, this option will get back to the action.
If not, you can go back to the demo.

^cF END GAME / VIEW SCORES

^cE If you want to end your current game for
whatever reason, this option will allow you
to.  The scores will be shown again.

When not in a game, this option turns into
"VIEW SCORES". Here you can check your and
your friends' achievements.


^P
^cF NIBBLES NOM NOM!

^cE While Commander Keen was busy constructing
his ComputerWrist,  he decided to put a
simple  Snake  ^cE game  on  his ComputerWrist.
He just finished  ^cA Nibbles Nom Nom!  ^cE by the
time he read Mortimer's message.  He will
probably get to other games later.

^cF HELP + GAME INFO

^cE Obviously the very section you are currently
reading,  containing all the information you
need regarding navigation, setup & gameplay.


^P
^cF CONFIGURE MENU

^cE This menu provides sound options, control
options, and game parameters you can change.

Choices for Sound Effects are:
^L80,20
^cA no sound effects
^L90,20
PC Speaker sound effects
^L100,20
Adlib/Sound Blaster sound effects

^cE Choices for Music are:
^L130,20
 ^cAnone
^L140,20
 Adlib/Sound Blaster


^P
^cF OPTIONS

^cE You can choose whether you want to see
the score box in the corner of the screen
as you play.  It is nice to have there, but
it can block your view sometimes!  And on
slower systems, removing the score box is
a very good idea.
Just press ^cA Enter ^cE when playing to pull down
the Status Window.

You can also turn the score box on or off
during the game without having to open the
menu.  Simply  press  ^cA Backspace  ^cE on  your
keyboard.


^P
^cF OPTIONS

^cE The second item is Two-Button Firing. If you
use a joystick, firing with the keyboard can
be a pain.  Two-Button Firing  is an option
that will fire your Stunner if both buttons
are down.  This can make high pogo jumps
more difficult, but it is okay once you get
used to it.

The third item is "Fix Jerky Motion".  If the
screen movement jerks around a lot, choose
this  option  to  fix  it.  See  the : section
"Command Line Parameters" for another way
to do this.


^P
^cF OPTIONS

^cE The fourth item in the options menu is SVGA
Compatibility. If you have an SVGA card and
you  have  display  problems,  you  can
turn compatibility mode on so your card will
work with Keen.

You  can  also  use  keyboard  or joystick
control.  If you choose keyboard, you can
redefine the control keys.  If you choose
joystick one or two, follow the prompts for
joystick calibration.  The current control
mode is at the bottom of the menu window.


^P
^cF NOTE TO SUPER VGA OWNERS

^cE If you own a Speedstar VGA card or other
non-100% compatible SVGA card, you'll need
to type "FITF /COMP" on the command line,
instead of just "FITF".  This should fix all
your problems.
An alternate method is choosing Configure,
then Options, then SVGA Compatibility in the
ComputerWrist menu.


^P
^cF OTHER NEAT-O COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS

^cE When some documentation tells you to type
more than just the name of the program
you want to run (like we did above), those
extra  bits  are  called  "command  line
parameters."  This is a fancy term for
extra information you can give the program
when you run it. Normally, you will never
have to type these.  If the program is
having trouble with your hardware, try the
appropriate parameter.


^P
^cFQUIT
^ce
Quit, for lack of a better word, quits.

Now go explore the ComputerWrist,
and have fun exploring the source
