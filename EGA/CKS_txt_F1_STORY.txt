^cFCOMMANDER KEEN in... "Goodbye, Galaxy!"
Keen Episode # : Foray in the Forest!
^cE
Billy Blaze has just come back home from
window  shopping  at his  most  favorite
confectionery kiosk.

He's still daydreaming about candies, cookies,
cakes, the like; if it's sugar, it's a sure bet
it will attract his attention, and an equally
sure bet that he'll be told he had best eat
his veggies before he gets any dessert.


^P
^cE
But darn it, Billy doesn't care for
seeds and greens!  The smell of
freshly fried dough,  the flavour
of sweet icing,  the sticky feel
left on his fingers as he clutches
the precious doughnut he imagines
himself eating...

Mmm, now he's definitely hungry.

But the minute he steps into his bedroom,
still daydreaming about the delicious sweets
he  just  saw,  it  becomes  clear  that
something is very wrong.

^cE Much  to  Billy's
alarm,  six of his
very  favorite
plushies seem to
have  vanished,
leaving nothing but
empty space where
they should be.

^G 10,10, 85     ## letter
It doesn't take
him  long  to
find  a  clue

^c2xxxx ^cE-

a piece of paper
on  his  bed,
with words in a
very  familiar
language which
he recognises as
the  Standard
Galactic Alphabet.

Reading the message, Billy discovers that the
loss of his plushies is no mere coincidence...

done something so despicable?"

kidnap my intergalactic friends?!"

It looks like it isn't time for Commander
Keen to take a break just yet.

^G 10,135, 85     ## letter
^cEStudying  the
letter intently,
especially  the
drawings  that
appear to be of
various planets
and nebulae,
Keen comes to
the  conclusion
that  he  must
pass through the
Dream Nebula and
make his way to
a  planet  with
strange  rings...

^cE
One thing's for sure  -  this won't be any
half-baked  adventure  that  would  make
anyone's eyes glaze over.

But first, he needs to prepare for another
trip into deepest space, and it looks like this
one won't be over before dinner time...

Hastily,  taking the portable parent monitor
receiver,  and making sure his parents are
occupied,  our intergalactic hero of justice
dons his brother's football helmet,  straps
himself into the Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket,
and  blasts  off  to new  and  unsuspected
adventures to rescue his friends.


^P
^cEOn board,  Keen sets the ship's autopilot
coordinates to  Gnosticus #  and locks in
on the signal of his favored intergalactic
streaming service:
