^cF ITEMS COMMANDER KEEN CAN GET

^cE Floating in the sky are ^cAraindrops.  ^cESince the
water of  Gnosticus #  has  life-sustaining
energy, if Keen collects a hundred raindrops,
he gets an extra life!

^cA Goodies!  ^cEThat's  what  Keen  is  here  for.
Somehow,  someone  pilfered  his  beloved
stuffed animals. Make sure to catch 'em all.

Note that Keen's ammo is now limited to 25
shots max. When Keen's  ^cANeural Stunner  ^cEis
fully charged,  he won't be able to pick up
any more ammo. But don't worry, there is
plenty of ammo hidden here and there. How
do you find it?  Well, keep on reading...

^cF SPECIAL STATUS WINDOW

^G30,8,82
^cE While in game you
can press the ^cARIGHT SHIFT ^cE key
in order to open
a special status
window, which
scans the area
for items you
have not collected
yet.
The red arrow down below points towards
the next set of Neural Stunners nearby. 
If you use diligence,  you might receive a
little bonus...


^p
^cF SCORE BOX

^G30,8,83
^cE In  game,  try  pressing
^cABACKSPACE ^cEon your keyboard.
It turns the score box on
or  off  during  the  game
without having to open the
menu. This comes in handy when you want to
make use of the entire screen to check for
enemies or secret areas. Your score is nice
to have there, but it can block your view
sometimes!


^p
^cF CHECKPOINTS
^G92,16,79
 
^cE Keen can reach checkpoints in levels.  When
you  come  across a  hopping  little  magic
mushroom, just touch it and the checkpoint
is activated. If you die during the level, you
can restart from the checkpoint.


^p
^cF CHECKPOINTS

^cE Beware, however. If you run out of lives and
reach a game over, you will lose all of your
level progress and have to start that level
over.

Checkpoints can only be used once per level,
and  only  the  most  recent  checkpoint is
counted. Use your checkpoints carefully! Don't
be afraid to save one for later.

May the magic power of mushrooms be with
you!


^p
^cF QUICK-SAVE / QUICK-LOAD

^cE Another neat feature is quick-saving and
quick-loading the game with just a single keystroke.

^L70,24
Quick-save: ^cA F5 ^cE
^L70,164
Quick-load: ^cA F9 ^cE

Note,  however,  that saving outside the
worldmap on  ^cA normal ^cE and ^cA hard  ^cE difficulty
costs one life.  You can learn more about
this in the "COMPUTERWRIST" help section.

^L 40, 10
said to contain highly	concentrated Slug Slime.
^L 50, 10
If you should ever run low on ammo,  you
^L 60, 10
can always return to one of these and refill

your Neural Stunner.

^cF CAST OF CHARACTERS
^G65,16,71

^cE There are quite a few foes in the Valley of
Foreshadowing.  Here is a list of the most
common ones:

^cA CHEMOLAIN. ^cE These stoic buddies
love to surf on flotsam.  They
don't really like to give way to
you.  On touch they react with
a change of skin coloration.
^c3 (c) by Neorice
^cA CROCODENT. ^cE This tiny darling
seems  pleasant,  but
appearances are deceptive.
Before you know it, it's gonna
trap and snap after you.

^cA DICKIE "DIG" DIGGENS. ^cE Also known
as notorious D-I-G.  Beware of
its spinning nose.  It will drill
its way through anything, no
matter what.
^c3 (c) by Neorice



^cA FAT RED CAT. ^cE Miaows like a cutie.
But make sure to steer clear
of it. Otherwise this kitten will
demonstrate its atomic impact.

^G30,16,73

^cA GELATIN SPOOPS. ^cE These jellylike
creatures appear and disappear
unexpectedly.  If Keen makes
contact  with  their  stunning
skin, he will feel muzzy for a
short moment.  Will he find a
way to bypass them?

^cA THE JANITOR. ^cE  He tries to clean
up the shemozzle. While mopping
up,  he shares his elaborate
gnostic knowledge.  Being the
only person on this planet, he
still has a lot of work to do. If
only he had some companions...

^G30,16,74

^cA LEGBERY. ^ce Inside this shrubbery
dozes a four-eyed spy. It will
follow your footsteps only to
shove you around.




^cA LEVAR. ^cE This  tousled  mini  FSM
fellow slides down poles.  Its
ball  of  noodly appendage  is
coated with a dangerous toxin.
So you better watch out when
it throws little ravels at you.


^P
^cF CAST OF CHARACTERS
^G30,16,75

^cA NISASI. ^cE These lively loons are
very clinging and really know
how to turn someone's head.
They will follow you till you
change direction. You better
shake them off.


^cA OPTIQUAT. ^cE One eye,  big mouth,
even bigger tongue. Woe betide
the hero that  wanders  near
one of these.  They will hound
you and  lick  you  to  death.
Avoid, avoid, avoid!

^P
^cF CAST OF CHARACTERS
^G30,16,76

^cA PUFFPUFF. ^ce Seems like this good
ol' fellow mutated somehow.
You better not nettle it or it
flies into a rage. Remember: Its
venomous spines are deadly to
the touch.


^cA PURPLE TENTACLE. ^ce It is attached
to a water lily via its suction
cup, pretending to be a flower.
But beware, it has an excellent
sense  of  touch  and  a
megalomaniac desire to take
over the world.

^cF CAST OF CHARACTERS
^G30,16,77

^cA SNEAKY TREE.  ^ceSomething shy
seems to be hidden inside this
tree trunk.  It avoids human
contact but can be helpful in
certain places.  If you  only
knew how to make it move...


^cA WADDLE.  ^ceThis cozy,  frugal,
hirsute  creature  puffs  Keen
aside  if he  comes  too  close.
You might want to tickle it a
little bit to find out what is
hidden in its pelt.

^cA ZIBBLINX. ^ce  Shying away from

daylight, these never-fully-seen
^L, 50, 96
subterranean menaces sneak a
^L, 60, 96
nervous peek -always in pairs-
^L, 70, 96
at what is  going on  above
^L, 80, 96
ground.  Their  signal  colour

indicates danger.

^L, 130, 10
There are way more monsters out there. We
^L, 140, 10
haven't even covered half of them yet, but
^L, 150, 10
discovering them for yourself is half the
^L, 160, 10
fun, isn't it!

^cF STANDARD GALACTIC ALPHABET
^G140,48,84

^cE Along the way Keen will come across textual
signs and directions which are depicted in
an alien language.  As every great traveller
through space knows, all these signs are
written in the ^cAStandard Galactic Alphabet.
^cE Throughout the galaxy, this is a guaranteed
way to get in contact with other sentient
races.  So it is of highest importance that
you get your homework done.
Here is a list that will help you decipher it.
