^cE Besides that you can do a lot of other fancy
things.  Let's take a tour, shall we...

You can  ^cAget things  ^cEsimply by walking into
them.

The ^cApogo stick ^cElets you jump higher, but it
is harder to control. Press Alt again to stop
using it.

If you are standing in front of a door,
pushing up will ^cAenter the door.

^cE To ^cAclimb a pole ^cEpress up or down when in
front of it. Press up or down to shinny up
or slide down the pole.  If you press the
right or left, you will swing around to face
that side.  You can get off the pole quickly
by pressing Jump (Ctrl).

You can ^cAgrab onto the edge ^cEof a surface if
you miss your destination.  Press Up or the
direction toward the surface you want to
be upon (left or right) to pull yourself up.
If  you  push  down  or  away  from  that 
surface, you'll fall down.

^cE If you see a ^cAswitch ^cE(it will have a red or
green light on it), just walk in front of it
and push up. Switches may change the state
of things around you, like oh say, bridges
and platforms and such.

If you are on a platform or narrow floor,
you can ^cAdrop down ^cEby pressing the down
arrow and jump.

Press the up or down arrow to ^cAsee more
^cEof the level in that direction. This is VERY
helpful  when  you  don't  think  there is
anything to jump onto.  Some hidden things
might be revealed by looking up or down.

Doors need ^cAgem-shaped keys ^cEto be placed in
their gem holders.  To place the gem in the
holder, just get the gem and walk up to it.

^cF ADVANCED MOVES

^cE There are some moves that can get you to
those "impossible-to-get-to" places.  Here
they are:

To perform the ^cAImpossible Pogo Trick ^cErun
left or right, then quickly press Pogo and
Jump in succession.  You will blast off at
an angle.

You can also pull out your pogo stick in the
middle of a normal jump - known as ^cAMid-Air
Pogo ^cE- giving you good control for that first
jump.


^P
^cF ADVANCED MOVES

^cE You can jump over a monster and ^cAshoot it
from above ^cEby pressing the down arrow and
firing.  And you can shoot upward or shoot
while on a pole.

You can ^cAclimb poles faster ^cEby holding down
the up arrow, and pressing jump repeatedly.
May take some practice, but it is worth it.

In many places you will see a big arc of
candy. These are usually set up so you can
get them in one cool jump.

There are other difficult moves, but we'll
let you find them on your own.

^cF FINISH A LEVEL

^cE To ^cAfinish a level ^cEyou can leave the level at
the Exit sign.

But be sure to have a little chat with the
Janitor, if he is around. He might give you
some hints and clues along the way.

And of course, take a look around
before you finish a level. You might
find goodies, sweets, tons of bonus
items,  and secret rooms as well
which are hidden in the game.
